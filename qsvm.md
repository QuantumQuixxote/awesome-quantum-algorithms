Usually, the linear equation is solved by the Harrow Hassidim Lloyd (HHL) algorithm. However, this algorithm requires many quantum gates. Tus, the HHL algorithm is hard to be executed by using a near-term quantum computer. Actually, this algorithm has experimentally  been verifed only for two and three qubits26â€“28. In addition, it requires a unitary operator to execute eiFt, which is quite hard to be implemented. 

Quantum Support Vector Machines evaluates the kernel using a quantum device, followed by fitting a classical SVM. The training of an SVM entails solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem. Kernel-based SVMs exhibit exceptional versatility as they can obtain nonlinear decision boundaries.
